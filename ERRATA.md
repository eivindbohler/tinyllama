### Hardware revision 1.1 errata
- The voltage potential between the anode and cathode on LEDs D2 and D3 is enough to dimly light them up in their off-state, instead of being completely shut off. A fix would be to use a tiny knife or scalpel and cut the trace between R11 and R22, and put a bodge wire beteen R11 and one of the +3.3V pads, for instance on P5.
